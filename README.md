# Hack2Rail Hackathon - Goodbye Chaos! Application

During the Hack2Rail Hackathon, our team developed a transport-related application aimed at enhancing the travel experience for passengers. Our application, "Goodbye Chaos!", focuses on three core features:

1. **Boarding Gate Navigation**:
    - **1.1** Assists passengers with or without luggage in navigating to their boarding gate based on the seat plan or carriage and luggage room.
    - **1.2** Utilizes simple sensors and wireless communication for smooth boarding.

2. **Real-time Disturbance Information and Next Trip Segment**:
    - **2.1** Connects to the disturbance real-time information API for trains ([Trafikinfo API](https://api.trafikinfo.trafikverket.se/)).
    - **2.2** Provides information on the next trip segment with public transport, e.g., SL ([Trafiklab API](https://www.trafiklab.se/node/12605/console)).
    - **2.3** Employs AI to predict the arrival time at the destination.

3. **Community Assistance and Reward System**:
    - **3.1** Allows passengers to ask for help from fellow app users.
    - **3.2** Implements a kudo token system to reward passengers who offer help.
    - **3.3** In case no help is available from fellow passengers, the request is notified to the personnel.

The details of the hackathon and our project can be found in the uploaded document (ID: 8f15ab52-6708-4333-8e74-13ea87f8bace).

As a part of the team, I was responsible for Python & Dashboard programming, contributing [significantly](https://github.com/parishwadomkar/GoodByeChaos/blob/main/Prototype_OM.png) to the development of the application. My role involved writing Python scripts to handle data processing and visualization, as well as creating dashboards to display real-time information and insights derived from the data.

The "Goodbye Chaos!" application is a testament to our team's commitment to improving the travel experience for passengers by leveraging technology and community support. We believe that our application can play a crucial role in making travel more seamless, enjoyable, and hassle-free for passengers.
